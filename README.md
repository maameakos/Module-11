This project focuses on a comprehensive web-scraping and data analysis challenge, building on my fundamental skills in HTML parsing, automated browsing, data extraction, and analysis. Utilizing tools such as Splinter and Beautiful Soup, I collected data from various web sources, organized and stored the extracted data, analyzed it, and visually communicated insights derived from the analysis. The objectives included identifying and extracting HTML elements using their id and class attributes, automating web browsing to collect data, and parsing HTML content to extract relevant information. I scraped various types of data, including HTML tables and recurring elements like news articles, and organized this data into a structured format for analysis.The analysis phase involved uncovering patterns, trends, and insights using statistical and computational techniques, followed by creating visual representations to effectively communicate these insights. Tools and technologies used in this project included Splinter for automated browsing, Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly for data visualization, with development and presentation facilitated through Jupyter Notebook. The workflow encompassed setting up the environment, web scraping, data cleaning and organization, data analysis, data visualization, and reporting. Contributions are welcome, and the project is licensed under the MIT License. By working on this project, I enhanced my skills in data collection, organization, analysis, and visualization, providing a solid foundation for tackling more complex data-driven challenges in the future.
